#A word of caution(DO NOT SKIP IT!)(I SAID READ IT!!!): Drinking is injurious to health. All bottles shown in the code do not promote drinking. Its a nursery rhyme, dont take it too seriously. I am really serious af. Also you can never try weed no matter what the world tells you, but once in a lifetime sounds good. For more theories on how marijuana is bliss, text me on github. I am open to queries and feedbacks.
